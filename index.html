                    Hello, my name is Noa Čanji and I'm a high school student. I'm currently attending Technical School 
                    Ruđer Bošković as a Computer Science Technitian and high Music School "Elly Bašić" as a french horn student; both where I'm in the third grade. 
                    I'm stationed in Zagreb, Croatia, where both of my schools are located. 
                    Programming is my hobby, so i like to learn as much as I can, despite the trouble of time that both of my schools 
                    require. I love playing music, and have been to few competitions over time. Currently, I'm trying to invest my time as much as I can 
                    to new challenges, especially in music, where i hope to find my future.
                </p>
